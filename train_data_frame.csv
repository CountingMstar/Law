tony,jack,jack a Hispanic man was charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder stemming from a failed robbery . During jury selection for his trial in California state court the prosecution used seven preemptory challenges to exclude each black or Hispanic prospective juror . jack challenged the prosecution 's use of preemptory challenges as a violation of the Supreme Court 's decision in Batson v. Kentucky which held that the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In accordance with Batson if a party can make a prima facie showing that preemptory challenges are being used in a racially motivated way the other party must give a non-racially motivated reason for their use of the preemptory challenges . The state court allowed the prosecution to give their non-racially motivated reasons in a closed hearing from which jack and his attorneys were excluded and subsequently found the prosecution 's use of preemptory challenges was not racially motivated . jack was not given the prosecution 's reasoning or a transcript of the meeting until after the conclusion of his trial . Additionally after the trial it was discovered that the vast majority of the questionnaires all the potential jurors had to fill out had been lost . jack was found guilty of the majority of the charges against him and sentenced to death .

In accordance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 the appellate court found that the California Supreme Court had not adjudicated jack 's claims of federal constitutional violations on the merits largely on the basis that the California Court had determined the procedure used for the Batson hearing violated California state law ; therefore the appellate court reviewed jack 's claims de novo and found that the exclusion of jack from the Batson hearing as well as the loss of the questionnaires violated jack 's constitutional rights . To determine whether the errors were harmless the Court of Appeals applied the standard set forth in Brecht v. Abrahamson which asked whether the errors had a substantial and injurious influence on the jury 's verdict and found that the exclusion of jack from the Batson hearing deprived him of the ability to prevail on a compelling Batson challenge . ,1

tony,jack,"tony was driving on a divided four-lane highway near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , when he was pulled over allegedly for violating a state law requiring drivers to use the left lane for passing only . Recognizing the car as a rental car , the officers asked tony for his license and rental agreement , which he had difficulty locating . Once he did locate them , the officers noted that the rental agreement did not list tony as an authorized driver , and when they ran his identification , they noted that he was using an alias and had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey . Despite the warrant ’ s indication that it did not request extradition from other jurisdictions , the officers attempted to contact authorities in New Jersey to confirm they did not seek tony ’ s arrest and extradition , allegedly following protocol for such situations . The officers experienced difficulty with their communications , however , and returned to tony ’ s car , where they asked him to exit the vehicle and about his warrant and alias . The officers asked whether tony had anything illegal in the car and then requested tony ’ s consent to search the car , noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement . The officers allege that tony gave his consent , but tony disputes this contention . The subsequent search turned up heroin and body armor in the trunk the car . At trial , tony moved to suppress the evidence , challenging the initial stop , the extension the stop , and the search . The district court determined that the violation the traffic law justified the initial stop and that the extension the stop was justified by the officers ’ developing reasonable suspicion criminal activity . tony maintains that he did not consent to the search , so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at all—that is , whether he had a reasonable expectation privacy in the rental vehicle , despite not being listed on the rental agreement . If he did not have a reasonable expectation privacy , then the officers ’ search the vehicle did not require his consent . There is a circuit split as to whether an unlisted driver a rental car has a reasonable expectation privacy in the rental vehicle , and the Third Circuit ( where the district court in this case sits ) has held that such a driver does not . Thus , the district court denied tony ’ s motion to suppress , and the Third Circuit , reviewing the factual questions for clear error and the legal question de novo , affirmed the judgment the district court .

Casey jack The Ninth Circuit also ruled that the Act 's lack an exception for abortions necessary to protect the health the mother rendered it unconstitutional jack Congress had included in the Act a finding that partial-birth abortions were never medically necessary but the Ninth Circuit held that the Supreme Court 's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart required the health exception in all cases where medical opinion on the necessity an abortion procedure is divided jack Finally the Circuit Court ruled that the Act was unconstitutionally vague because the inclusion ambiguous statutory terms such as `` partial-birth abortion '' would prevent physicians from knowing which methods abortion were covered jack The Circuit Court determined that the proper course action was to block enforcement the entire Act jack ,1
